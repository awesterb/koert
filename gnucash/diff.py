# Some general code concerning "difference functions".
# A *difference function*  diff  assigns to each pair A B of objects
# an object diff(A,B) with the following properties:
#   differ      A boolean which denotes whether A and B differ.
#   difference  The data of the difference.
#
# The EqDiff difference function checks whether A and B are equal.
# The Indiff difference function (which stands for indiscrete
# function and not indifferent, of course) always returns False.
#
# Let  diff  be a difference function.  This yields an obvious
# pointwise difference function on dictionaries called  DictDiff(diff).
#
# We can go deeper:
# A dictionary forms a node of a labeled tree, whose labels are the
# keys, whose leaves are the non-dictionary values and the remaining
# values (being dictionaries) are the child-nodes.
#   Recursive application of DictDiff yields a difference function
# of these trees called  DeepDictDiff(diff).
